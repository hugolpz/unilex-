Frequency list in language {xxx} requires correction. I would like to help curate this frequency list. Could you share instructions to do so ?

### Target language
- [ ] My language's Wikipedia page is : {add your language wikipedia page here}
- [ ] (optional) My language code is : {add your language code here}

### Questionnaire.
Please tick the boxes if you agree.
- [ ] I understand the curation works is done on github, via online text editing.
- [ ] I understand the review consist in reading hundreds words of the list, and when the word is NOT from my language to just deleting that starting `#`.
- [ ] I understand the lines and words without heading `#` will now be ignored.
- [ ] I understand that no other edit are necessary.

This method makes it super fast to do. A motivated volunteer can review about 1,000 to 2,000 words per hour.
