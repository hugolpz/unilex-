Frequency list in language {xxx} requires correction.
I would like to help curate this frequency list.
Could you share instructions to do so ?

### Target language
- [ ] My language's Wikipedia page is : {add your language wikipedia page here}
- [ ] (optional) My language code is : {add your language code here}

### Questionnaire
I understand the following (add `x` when ok):
- [ ] the curation is done on github, via online text editing.
- [ ] this method is super fast. A motivated volunteer can review about 1,000 to 2,000 words per hour.
- [ ] when the word is NOT from my language I just press `delete` on that line's heading `#`.
- [ ] lines and words without heading `#` will now be ignored.
- [ ] to move to next word, press the down arrow key `↓`.
- [ ] I understand that no other edit are necessary.

A maintainer of this repository will create the file to edit and submit you its link. Please click `Submit New Issue` green button ↘ and come back on github next week.
